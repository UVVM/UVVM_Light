#  UVVM Light
UVVM (Universal VHDL Verification Methodology) is a free and Open Source Methodology and Library for making very structured VHDL-based testbenches.

Overview, Readability, Maintainability, Extensibility and Reuse are all vital for FPGA development efficiency and quality.
UVVM VVC (VHDL Verification Component) Framework was released in 2016 to handle exactly these aspects.

UVVM Light is a low threshold version of UVVM and is intended for developers who want to start using UVVM Utilty library and BFMs (Bus Functional Models).

UVVM Light consists currently of the following elements:
- Utility Library
- BFMs (Bus Functional Models)


## Issues and pull requests
UVVM Light is a subset of UVVM v2, thus any issues and pull requests has to be performed on the [UVVM repository](https://github.com/UVVM/UVVM). 


## Compilation
Compiling UVVM Light is be done by calling the `script/compile.do` script with a relative or absolut path to UVVM Light install directory
```sh
$ vsim -c -do "do [uvvm_light directory]/script/compile.do [uvvm_light directory] [target directory]"
```

E.g. compiling from the /sim folder inside the UVVM Light install directory:
```sh
$ vsim -c -do "do ../script/compile.do [uvvm_light directory] [target directory]"
```
or from the Modelsim terminal:
```sh
do ../script/compile.do [uvvm_light directory] [target directory]
```

Note that compile.do can have 0, 1 or 2 arguments:
- 0 argument: `uvvm_light directory` is set to "..", `target directory` is set to "."
- 1 argument: `uvvm_light directory` is set to argument, `target directory` is set to "."
- 2 arguments: `uvvm_light directory` is set to argument 1, `target directory` us set to argument 2


# Demo
A simple demonstration testbench is provided along with UVVM Light and is located in the /sim folder. 

Steps to run demo:
1. Run compile_and_run_demo.do / run_demo.bat / run_demo.sh in /sim folder
